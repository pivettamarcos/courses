## Course Overview
The Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark is one of the most challenging exams. It's great at assessing how well you understand not just Data Frame APIs, but also how you make use of them effectively as part of implementing Data Engineering Solutions, which makes Databricks Associate certification incredibly valuable to have and pass. Rest assured, I've passed it myself with a score of 90%.

This is going to be a long journey, but passing the Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark exam will be worth it!

This Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark is different from the other ones you'll find on Udemy. You are the better judge.

- First, we will make sure we have the right environment based on Databricks to practice. If you do not have the environment don't worry, you will be guided to set up the environment using Azure
- Once the environment is ready you will be guided to upload the material and also data sets for practice
- It covers in-depth all the new topics on the Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark exam using Pyspark.
- It's packed with practical knowledge on how to use Pyspark Data Frame APIs inside and out as a Data Engineer using Databricks Platform
- It teaches you how to prepare for the Databricks exam AND how to prepare for the real world leveraging Pyspark Data Frame APIs.
- It's a logical progression of topics, not a laundry list of random services
- It's fast-paced and precise to the point
- All the material will be made available as a Databricks Archive. Just upload it into your platform and start using it

Concretely, here's what we'll learn to pass the Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark exam:

- Setup of Databricks Environment using Azure
- The Databricks CLI and important commands to interact with DBFS. It will be used to quickly set up the data for practice.
- In-Depth Data Frame APIs using Pyspark that are relevant for the exam.
