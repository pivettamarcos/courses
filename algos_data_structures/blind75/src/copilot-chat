how to initialize struct in c

## Copilot ---

In C, you can initialize a struct at the time of declaration. Here's an example:

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float salary;
};

int main() {
    struct Person person1 = {"John Doe", 30, 55000.0f};

    printf("Name: %s\nAge: %d\nSalary: %.2f\n", person1.name, person1.age, person1.salary);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, a struct `Person` is defined with three members: `name`, `age`, and `salary`. Then, in the `main` function, an instance of `Person` named `person1` is declared and initialized with the values "John Doe", 30, and 55000.0 respectively. The `printf` function is then used to print these values.
